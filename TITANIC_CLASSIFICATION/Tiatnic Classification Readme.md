# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This Python script/classification model predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy 🔢: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib 📊 and Seaborn 🌊: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn 🧮: For building and evaluating the classification model.

## Model Used

The classification model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script `titanic_classification.py`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
3. Run the script to train the model and make predictions on the test set.

## Sample Output

The script generates visualizations of the data, trains the Random Forest Classifier, evaluates the model using cross-validation, and makes predictions on the test set. It also prints the accuracy score and confusion matrix of the model.
