# 📈 Stock Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for stock prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It uses historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance for four tech companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) to train the model and predict future stock prices.

- Pandas 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy 🔢: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib 📊 and Seaborn 🌊: For data visualization.
- Pandas Datareader and yfinance 📈: For fetching stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Datetime 📅: For working with dates and times.
- Sklearn 🧮: For data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler).
- Keras ⚙️: For building and training the LSTM model.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file `stock_prediction.ipynb`.
2. Open the file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the LSTM model and make stock price predictions.

## Example Output

The notebook generates visualizations of stock prices, moving averages, daily returns, correlation analysis, and LSTM model predictions. It also calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the predictions.
